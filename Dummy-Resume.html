    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Rick is a male human whose current biological body possibly makes him around 70 years old with a sometimes-hunched pose from poring over his scientific endeavors. He has slight eyebags, a unibrow accompanied by a crease on his forehead and the bottom of his lips are usually covered in green drool from near-constant intoxication. He has spiked grayish-blue hair with a bald spot on the back of his head and dirty gray skin. He dominantly wears a short-sleeve light blue shirt tucked into brown pants held up by a black belt with a gold buckle, a long-sleeve white coat, white socks and black shoes.</p>
